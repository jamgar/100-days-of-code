# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started a landing page. Finished the responsive navigation and banner.

**Thoughts:** I wanted an overlay with a image in the background. Found some resources to help me and implemented a gradient overlay. Overall was pleased with the outcome.
