# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 25, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Started a landing page. Finished the responsive navigation and banner.

**Thoughts:** I wanted an overlay with a image in the background. Found some resources to help me and implemented a gradient overlay. Overall was pleased with the outcome.

### Day 2: March 26, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added Gallery and Services section to landing page. Used CSS Grid to make site responsive.

**Thoughts**: Had fun learning and using CSS Grid.


### Day 3: March 27, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Added an on hover image overlay to the Gallery section of landing page.

**Thoughts** Had to look at different references to understand what the CSS was actually doing. I want to understand what I am coding instead of just copy and pasting.
